# ERP Enhancements — Future Plan

## 1. Data & Workflows

- **Bulk actions**: Multi-select and bulk approve, pay, or close across invoices/items
- **Approval workflows**: Configurable approval rules by amount, document type, or user
- **Audit trail**: Who changed what, when — for invoices, customers, payments
- **Reporting & analytics**: Dashboards, charts, exportable reports (revenue, aging, cash flow)

## 2. UX & Productivity

- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Shortcuts for frequent actions (create, save, search)
- **Quick actions / macros**: Reusable flows (e.g. "Create invoice from PO")
- **Saved views & filters**: User-defined filters and sort orders
- **Batch import**: Import from Excel/CSV with mapping and validation

## 3. Integrations & Automation

- **Webhooks / events**: Notify external systems when invoices, payments, etc. change
- **Workflow triggers**: When invoice is approved → send to accounting system
- **API-first**: Stable REST/GraphQL API for integrations and extensions

## 4. Suggested Priority

| Priority | Feature | Effort |
|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Keyboard shortcuts | Low |
| 2 | Bulk actions (multi-select) | Low–Medium |
| 3 | Audit trail (history) | Medium |
| 4 | Saved filters / views | Medium |
| 5 | Approval workflows | High |
| 6 | Dashboards & reporting | High |
| 7 | Batch import | Medium–High |
